Ultrasonic Sensor ROS 2 Node.

This module implements a ROS 2 node (`UltrasonicSensorNode`) that interfaces with an ultrasonic distance
sensor (e.g., HC-SR04) connected via GPIO on a Raspberry Pi. The node periodically measures the distance
to nearby obstacles and publishes the result as a `std_msgs/Float32` message on the `/ultrasonic/distance` topic.

The sensor uses a trigger/echo mechanism:
- A short pulse is sent via the trigger pin.
- The echo pin listens for the reflected pulse.
- The time between send and receive is used to calculate the distance using the speed of sound.

This node is designed for integration into autonomous vehicle systems, particularly for obstacle avoidance logic.

GPIO configuration:
- Trigger pin (output): GPIO 11 (green wire)
- Echo pin (input): GPIO 9 (blue wire)

    UltrasonicSensorNode.

    A ROS2 node for interfacing with an ultrasonic sensor to measure distances and publish them as Float32
    messages on the '/ultrasonic/distance' topic.
    Methods:
        __init__():
            Initializes the node by setting up the ROS publisher and timer for periodic distance measurements.
            Also configures the GPIO pins for the ultrasonic sensor trigger and echo operations.
        read_and_publish():
            Calls get_distance() to acquire a measurement.
            If the measurement is valid, wraps the distance in a Float32 message and publishes it.
            Logs the measured distance or a warning if the measurement is invalid.
        get_distance():
            Triggers the ultrasonic sensor by sending a pulse and waits for the echo response.
            Implements timeout mechanisms to avoid indefinite blocking while waiting for the sensor's response.
            Calculates and returns the distance based on the elapsed time and the speed of sound if the value is
            within a valid range (approximately 0.02 to 4.0 meters).
            Returns None if a timeout occurs or if the calculated distance is out of range.
        destroy_node():
            Performs cleanup of GPIO resources to prevent resource leaks.
            Calls the superclass's destroy_node() to handle additional shutdown procedures.
