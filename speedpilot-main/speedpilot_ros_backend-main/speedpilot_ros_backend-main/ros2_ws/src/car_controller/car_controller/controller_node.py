    """
    CarController Node.

    This class implements a ROS2 node to control a carâ€™s movement and steering through GPIO-based PWM signals.
    It configures GPIO pins for forward and backward motor control, as well as for steering, and sets a mode LED
    to indicate a 'wait' state. Vehicle commands received via a ROS subscription are processed to adjust movement
    and steering accordingly.
    Attributes:
        motor_forward_pin (int): BCM pin number for forward motor control.
        motor_backward_pin (int): BCM pin number for backward motor control.
        motor_steering_pin (int): BCM pin number for steering control.
        motor_forward (GPIO.PWM): PWM object used for driving forward.
        motor_backward (GPIO.PWM): PWM object used for driving backward (and steering in this implementation).
        subscription: ROS subscription for receiving VehicleCommand messages.
    Methods:
        __init__():
            Initializes the node by setting up GPIO pins, configuring GPIO warnings,
            establishing PWM channels for each motor output, initializing a mode LED, and
            subscribing to the 'vehicle_command' topic for incoming commands.
        command_callback(msg: VehicleCommand):
            Callback function for processing incoming vehicle command messages.
            It logs the received command and drives the car forward or backward based on the speed value,
            and adjusts the steering according to the angle provided in the message.
        drive_forward(speed):
            Activates the forward motor by setting its PWM duty cycle based on the given speed (0-100%).
            It ensures the backward motor's PWM is set to 0 to prevent conflict.
        drive_backward(speed):
            Activates the backward motor by setting its PWM duty cycle based on the given speed (0-100%).
            It ensures the forward motor's PWM is set to 0 to prevent conflict.
        set_steering(angle):
            Adjusts the PWM duty cycle for steering based on the provided angle.
            The default (center) duty cycle is 7.5%; it is adjusted within a range (5.0% to 10.0%)
            proportionally to the angle to steer left or right.
